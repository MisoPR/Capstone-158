        <p>
          The sun is our primary source of renewable energy, due to its higher
          irradiance at the location of Puerto Rico it can be crucial <br />
          for the improvement of the electric grid in the island. Increases in
          electric bills, <br />
          lack of good administration throughout the years, continuous
          blackouts, and natural disasters <br />
          such as hurricanes have made the grid unreliable. In addition,
          excessive reliance on fossil fuels <br />
          for electricity generation has been a significant problem recently
          because of warlike <br />conflicts between major distributors
          incrementing its cost and the environmental pollution that it causes.
          <br />
          Therefore, PV systems have become a viable solution for many customers
          and for the industrial sector with power hungry companies.
